![Ralph Wyld](/images/ralphwyld.jpeg)

I’m Ralph Wyld, vibraphonist, percussionist, and composer. My album [Subterranea](https://mosaicuk.bandcamp.com/album/subterranea), released on Edition Records in 2016, was described as an “outstanding debut” by Mojo magazine. I also have a duo called [Imprint](https://imprint.band) with cellist and composer Cecilia Bignall, and we’ve recorded [some music](https://ensembleimprint.bandcamp.com). 

Since 2012 I’ve enjoyed playing with the “queen of psychedelic Arabic jazz”, [Yazz Ahmed](https://www.yazzahmed.com). We’re touring her new album, [A Paradise in the Hold](https://yazzahmed.bandcamp.com/album/a-paradise-in-the-hold), at the moment, and also exploring an exciting new duo format.

I specialise in the adventurous and unusual fringes of contemporary British jazz. As such I play, or have played, a lot of odd time signatures and crunchy harmony with projects like Luke Bainbridge’s [Surface Tension](https://www.lukebainbridge.com/SurfaceTension) and [Miguel Gorodi’s Nonet](https://miguelgorodi.com/miguel-gorodi-nonet/). I also play with spiritual jazz flautist [Chip Wickham](https://chipwickham.com), and acid-jazz legends [James Taylor Quartet](https://www.jamestaylorquartet.co.uk/jtq/).
