My first gig with Yazz was back in 2012, at the very first iteration of [Jazz in the Round](). That was a trio completed by Dave Manington, and the 3 of us have been playing together ever since. We tour mostly as a quartet, and until recently the band featured the late, great, and sorely missed, Martin France on drums.

Yazz and I have had the opportunity to play as a duo recently, which has a totally different feel from the quartet. Although some of the music is the same, the arrangements are brand new, and feature electronics, tracks, and loops. I also play both marimba and vibraphone on the gigs.
