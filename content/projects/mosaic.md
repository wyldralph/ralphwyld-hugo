Formed around 2014, whilst I was studying at the Royal Academy of Music in London, Mosaic is a vehicle to bring together jazz and contemporary classical influences. The band is currently on hiatus, but lined up as a sextet, featuring trumpet, bass clarinet, cello, vibraphone, bass, and drums. 

Mosaic recorded my debut album, Subterranea, released in 2016, and played a number of UK and European dates on the subsequent tour. A personal highlight for me was playing live on BBC Radio 3's Jazz Now.

Mosaic has also been at the core of several other projects. Along with cellist and composer Cecilia Bignall, I produced a collaborative project between Mosaic and the JÃ¸rgensen Trio, playing new compositions inspired by Lewis Carrol's Alices Adventures in Wonderland at the 20XX Daunt Books Festival. Then, in XX, I was commisioned by Lancaster Jazz Festival to write a suite of music inspired by artist Paul Klee, and performed it with Mosaic with special guests.

Musicians who have performed with Mosaic include:
- Cecilia Bignall
- James Copus
- Sam Rapley
- Misha Mullov-Abbado
- Scott Chapman
- Max Luthert
- Dave Hamblett
- Eliot Galvin
- Iosif Purits
- John Garner
- Will Glaser
