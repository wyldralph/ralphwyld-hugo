>"Award-winning pianist and composer Rick Simpson has been no stranger to the heart of the London Jazz scene – on both the new music and more traditional fronts – for many years now, and with Klammer he has a group which gives full voice to his ambitious and exciting compositions.
>His music for Klammer focuses on through-composition, complex ensemble playing and modern textures/rhythms, though with enough space for soloists to shine and plenty of wit and levity to boot.
>The band is completed by some of the young London Jazz scene’s most sought-after rising stars."
