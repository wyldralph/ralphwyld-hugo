> "Luke’s debut album presents the latest line-up of Surface Tension (Kieran McLeod on trombone, Ralph Wyld on vibes and Huw V Williams on bass), born out of the recent pandemic restrictions. Living locally to one another, the band were able to rehearse safely outdoors at a social distance. This period not only deepened the project's strong roots in groove and contemporary classical music, but also took exciting new steps into the world of free improvisation. Culminating in a set of original music, the band went into ‘the shed’ to record on the 8th October 2020, which was mixed and mastered by Sam Baldwin at Town Studios. Coming on the heels of this debut release, and a run of launch gigs, this exciting new quartet is set to make an impression within the UK music scene."
