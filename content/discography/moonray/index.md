> "James Hudson is proud to present the brand-new album Moonray. In addition to a well versed and trusted rhythm section, Moonray features horns, strings and vibraphone, resulting in a showcase of a unique thirteen-piece band, projecting a high impact sound that perfectly compliments James Hudson’s mesmerising vocals.
